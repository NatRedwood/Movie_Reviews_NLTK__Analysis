    "<p>As it can be concluded, the word 'not', even if used in the positive category, does not always indicate a negative meaning and is very often used as a negative particle: 'when not laughing aloud', 'can not experience human', 'i do not advocate', 'i ' m not trying', 'are not stupid'. Ihe last example especially is the evidence for language ambiguity. Even though the particle 'not' has a logical negative connotation, it actually reverses another word's negative connotation ('stupid'). There are some occurences that are still suprising, e.g. 'he is not happy with the final product'. However, without the context, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions.</p>\n",
    "<p>The word 'no' is often used in similar contexts as 'not': 'there is is no book of shadows', 'there is no goddamned blair witch', 'i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness'. Even if something is negated in the review, it does not mean that the overall feeling about the movie is negative. The word 'no' indicates often the lack of a feature which is treated as a positive thing about a particular movie. The fixed phrase 'no matter... (if, how, who)' seems to a frequent occurence but it does not indicate either positivity or negativity of the whole review.<br>\n",
    "<p>Concluding, 'no' and 'not', regardless of being negation particles, cannot be used as negative reviews indicators. The surprising frequency distribution counts are better understood and explained after the analysis of concordances.</p>"
